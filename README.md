# JS-Jquery-and-JSON
## This repo contains the code of JS that I am learning from Coursera
### Imp points in JS:
1. '$' can be a variable
2. JS is inspired from C
3. == operator checks for value i.e. implicit type conversion happens and === operator checks for datatype and value i.e. no type conversion
