# JS-Jquery-and-JSON
## This repo contains the code of JS 
### Imp points in JS:
1. '$' can be a variable
2. JS is inspired from C
3. == operator checks for value i.e. implicit type conversion happens and === operator checks for datatype and value i.e. no type conversion
4. '+' for string concatination even the non strings can also be concatenated using + operator
5. var represents a variable has local scope
6. DOM (Document Object Model) in JS is a hierrarchial structure that which represents all the objects and tags as nodes in the tree. Different browsers will have different types of DOM for a application. The DOM is not same for every browser and the code written in JS might not work for all the browsers. So, the developers cam with a fucntion that can support by every browser called getElementbyId(). This function will find the id in wherever the DOM. 
7. With Jquery you don't need to modify the DOM directly and you no need to generate the HTML code dynamically for more clarity refer complex.html page.
