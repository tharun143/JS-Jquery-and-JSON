# JS-Jquery-and-JSON
## This repo contains the code of JS that I am learning from Coursera
### Imp points in JS:
1. '$' can be a variable
2. JS is inspired from C
3. == operator checks for value i.e. implicit type conversion happens and === operator checks for datatype and value i.e. no type conversion
4. + for string concatination even the non strings can also be concatenated using + operator
5. var represents a variable has local scope
6. DOM (Document Object Model) in JS is a hierrarchial structure that which represents all the objects and tags as nodes in the tree. Different browsers will have different types of DOM for a application. The DOM is not same for every browser and the code written in JS might not work for all the browsers. So, the developers cam with a fucntion that can support by every browser called getElementbyId(). This function will find the id in wherever the DOM.
